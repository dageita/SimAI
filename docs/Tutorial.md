# üåü Introduction

SimAI is a comprehensive large-scale AI training simulation toolkit that provides three major simulation scenarios:

1. **SimAI-Analytical** - An analytical simulation tool that abstracts underlying network communication details. It adopts a simplified approach using busbw (bus bandwidth) to estimate communication time for collective/point-to-point communications, enabling rapid scenario validation. Key application scenarios include (but are not limited to):

    * *Performance Analysis*: Compare completion times across different models (e.g., studying the impact of Expert numbers on MoE model training performance)

    * *Framework-level Parallel Parameter Optimization*: Balance and optimize TP/EP/PP parameters to analyze end-to-end timing effects

    * *Scale-up Exploration*: Investigate parallel parameter performance across different scale-up domains for specific scenario optimization

    * *Scale-out Bandwidth Selection*: Research cost-effective bandwidth configurations for various GPU performances

> üí° *Currently supports manual busbw.yaml configuration. Automatic busbw inference based on parallel scenarios will be open-sourced soon. Stay tuned and feel free to contact us for more details. ‚ú®*

2. **SimAI-Simulation(NS-3)** - A high-fidelity, full-stack simulation tool that can theoretically integrate with any pure network simulator. It provides fine-grained reproduction of communication behaviors during LLM training. Currently supports NS-3 as the network backend (we encourage integration of new network simulation tools). Key research areas include:

    * *Collective Communication Algorithm Research*: Design and optimize collective communication traffic patterns for non-switch architectures and other emerging network topologies
    
    * *Network Protocol Research*: Evaluate and optimize network protocols, congestion control algorithms, routing mechanisms and other low-level network technologies across different architectures
    
    * *Novel Network Architecture Design*: Explore innovative network architectures

> üí° We strongly encourage researchers to build upon SimAI-Simulation for innovative extensions and breakthrough research suitable for top-tier conferences. Join our community or reach out via email - we're committed to providing technical support for promising research directions! ‚ú®

3. **SimAI-Physical(TODO)**

For additional functionalities of each component, please refer to [SimCCL](https://github.com/aliyun/SimCCL) and [ns-3-alibabacloud](https://github.com/aliyun/ns-3-alibabacloud).

# üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

Under normal circumstances, running SimAI requires generating a Workload file using the [AICB](https://github.com/aliyun/aicb?tab=readme-ov-file#generate-workloads-for-simulation-simai) tool. To create a precise Workload, you may need to utilize the AIOB feature to determine the timing of various computational kernels, which necessitates a GPU environment. Therefore, we recommend executing the SimAI full-stack toolkit directly within the latest **NGC image**.

> üí° **Important Note**: SimAI-Simulation compilation requires removing ninja (which comes pre-installed in NGC images). You can remove it using:
> ```bash
> apt remove ninja-build && pip uninstall ninja
> ```

Build Instructions:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/aliyun/SimAI.git
$ cd ./SimAI/

# Clone submodules
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
# Make sure to use the newest commit
$ git submodule update --remote

# Compile SimAI-Analytical
$ ./scripts/build.sh -c analytical

# Compile SimAI-Simulation (ns3)
$ ./scripts/build.sh -c ns3
```

# üåê SimAI-Analytical Usage
## üìù Workload Generate

To generate workloads for simulation, use the [SimAI-WorkloadGenerator](https://github.com/aliyun/aicb?tab=readme-ov-file#generate-workloads-for-simulation-simai) feature in [AICB](https://github.com/aliyun/aicb). This will produce a `.txt` file similar to [workload_analytical.txt](../example/workload_analytical.txt), which includes:

- `model_parallel_NPU_group`: Represents the size of Tensor Parallelism
- `ep`: Represents the size of Expert model parallelism
- `pp`: Represents the size of pipeline model parallelism
- `vpp`: Virtual Pipeline Parallelism (default: `--num-layers-per-virtual-pipeline-stage=1` for minimal PP bubble)

> üí° *For more details, refer to the [AICB Workload Tutorial](https://github.com/aliyun/aicb/blob/master/training/tutorial.md#workload)*

## üîß Busbw Setting

SimAI-Analytical abstracts lower-level network details by directly specifying busbw to estimate collective communication times. To customize communication busbw for various scenarios, you can use a [busbw.yaml](../example/busbw.yaml) file in the following format:

```yaml
test
TP:
  allreduce,: 300      # AllReduce busbw 300GB/s in TP
  allgather,: 280
  reducescatter,: 280
  alltoall,: 230
DP:
  allreduce,: null
  allgather,: 380      # AllGather busbw 380GB/s in DP
  reducescatter,: 380
  alltoall,: null
EP:
  allreduce,: null
  allgather,: 45       # AllGather busbw 45GB/s in DP_EP
  reducescatter,: 45   # ReduceScatter busbw 45GB/s in DP_EP
  alltoall,: 80        # AlltoAll busbw 80GB/s in EP
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Analytical Simulation

To run the analytical simulation, use the following command:

```bash
$ ./bin/SimAI_analytical -w example/workload_analytical.txt -g 9216 -g_p_s 8 -r test- -busbw example/busbw.yaml
```

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Long Form | Description |
|:---------:|:----------|:------------|
| `-w` | `--workload` | Specifies the path to the Workload File |

| `-g_p_s` | `--gpus-per-server` | Specifies the Scale-up size |
| `-r` | `--result` | Specifies the output file path and prefix (default: `./results/`)<br>Recommended to include simulation parameters, e.g.,<br>`A100-llama405b-tp8-pp16-dp128-ga16-ep1-NVL8` |
| `-busbw` | `--bus-bandwidth` | Specifies the path to the busbw file<br>(recommend modifying `example/busbw.yaml` directly) |

### Optional Parameters

### Communication Group Overlap Ratios

The following parameters specify the overlap ratios for communication groups (default: 0, indicating no overlap):

> üìù *Due to the variety of overlap strategies and scenario-dependent overlap ratios, we prioritize simple and efficient methods to directly specify overlap conditions.*
